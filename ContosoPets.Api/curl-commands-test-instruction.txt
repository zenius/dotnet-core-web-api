Notes:
    -i, --include: displays the HTTP response headers.
    -d implies an HTTP POST operation and defines the request body.
    -H indicates that the request body is in JSON format.
    The header's value overrides the default content type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
    
    -k, --insecure: This option explicitly allows curl to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.
    All SSL connections are attempted in secure mode using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. 
    This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless -k, --insecure is used.(SSL).

    -s, --silent: Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter or error messages.

    jq: The JSON is sent to the jq command-line JSON processor for improved display.

    -X, --request: This flag will used to send custom request to the server. 
    Most of the time we do GET, HEAD, and POST. 
    But if you need specific request like PUT, FTP, DELETE then you can use this flag

1. POST Request 
// Invalid post request 
// The field Price must be between 0.01 and 7.92281625142643E+28.
  curl -i -k \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"name\":\"Plush Squirrel\",\"price\":0.00}" \
    https://localhost:5001/products


// Valid post request 
curl -i -k \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"name\":\"Plush Squirrel\",\"price\":12.99}" \
    https://localhost:5001/products


2. GET Request 
  // Get all products 
  curl -k -s https://localhost:5001/products | jq

 // Get product by id 
  curl -k -s https://localhost:5001/products/3 | jq

3. PUT Request 
  curl -i -k \
    -X PUT \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Knotted Rope\",\"price\":14.99}" \
    https://localhost:5001/products/2
